# Volleyball Game
Hey there! Here is the project that I led the creation of in my university's Game Development Club. The signs that it is a first attempt at a video game is definitely obvious and the project management deadlines surrounding Midterms is definitely obvious, but it was a fun little project to make so I hope you enjoy playing it!

## How to Play

You will have to play the game directly within the Unity Engine at the moment and there is definitely a lot of bugs (Itch.io link incoming) but hopefully it is all good for now!
